# Google Lead Scraper

This is a tool to scrape leads from Google Maps. It uses the Google Maps Places API to search for businesses and then store the results.  

## Hints

### Don't crawl for types
Don't crawl for business types. Many businesses don't specify a specific type and then you won't find them.  
The best way is to use a text search for the type. Google will figure it out and many businesses have their profession in their name.
